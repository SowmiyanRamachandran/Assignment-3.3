List the components of Hadoop 2.x :

Hadoop 2.x is a high-level architecture that overcomes the limitations of hadoop 1.x.

Hadoop Common Module is a Hadoop Base API (A Jar file) for all Hadoop Components. All other components works on top of this module.
HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It is also know as HDFS V2 as it is part of Hadoop 2.x with some enhanced features.
It is used as a Distributed Storage System in Hadoop Architecture.

YARN stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator. It is new Component in Hadoop 2.x Architecture.
MapReduce is a Batch Processing or Distributed Data Processing Module. It is also know as “MR V1” as it is part of Hadoop 1.x with some updated features.
Remaining all Hadoop Ecosystem components work on top of these three major components: HDFS, YARN and MapReduce.

Three major components of Hadoop 2.x:
1.HDFC
2.YARN
3.MapReduce

ResourceManager:A scheduler that allocates available resources in the cluster amongst the competing applications.

NodeManager:Runs on each node in the cluster and takes direction from the ResourceManager. It is responsible for managing resources available on a single node.

ApplicationMaster:An instance of a framework-specific library, an ApplicationMaster runs a specific YARN job and is responsible for negotiating
resources from the ResourceManager and also working with the NodeManager to execute and monitor Containers.
The actual data processing occurs within the Containers executed by the ApplicationMaster. A Container grants rights to an application
to use a specific amount of resources (memory, cpu etc.) on a specific host.

YARN is not the only new major feature of Hadoop 2.0. HDFS has undergone a major transformation with a collection of new features that
include:
1.NameNode HA:Automated failover with a hot standby and resiliency for the NameNode master service.
2.Snapshots:Point-in-time recovery for backup, disaster recovery and protection against use errors.
3.Federation:A clear separation of namespace and storage by enabling generic block storage layer.
NameNode HA is achieved using existing components like ZooKeeper along with new components like a quorum of JournalNodes and the ZooKeeper
Failover Controller (ZKFC).Federation enables support for multiple namespaces in the cluster to improve scalability and isolation.
Federation also opens up the architecture, expanding the applicability of HDFS cluster to new implementations and use cases.
